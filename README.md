# HW_04: NotaCS40Bot

## A. Purrpose
From our very first assignment in this class, I've stuck to a cat theme in my CS40 work. Since Prof. Izbicki said it was only a suggestion to make our bot politically focused, I decided to make my bot cat themed instead! You'll see just how purrfect the bot work is. ðŸ˜½

#### Files Included
```bot.py``` Main file for NotaCS40bot, that will start leaving comments and replies as specified. \
```new_submission.py``` This file will make new submissions to a subreddit, manually alternating between making posts with text from generate_comment function and sharing posts from other threads.\
```vote_bot.py``` 

## B. Favorite Comment
My favorite threads for my bot to comment on were those about cats. NotaCS40bot responded to many cat related posts that were shared in various subreddits. A screenshot of a funny reply is attached below.

My bot's comments on this [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/redditdev/comments/7l9xju/how_to_post_new_threads_with_praw/) seemed pretty hilarious, so I'm sharing it as my favorite. \
[Replying to a political post about Obama with a silly sentence about kittens](https://old.reddit.com/r/BotTownFriends/comments/r3kpmk/i_love_the_way_her_little_ears_move_in_rhythm/hmc9ob0/) is the comment that makes me smile most.
