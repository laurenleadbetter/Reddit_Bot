# HW_04: NotaCS40Bot

## A. Purrpose
From our very first assignment in this class, I've stuck to a cat theme in my CS40 work. Since Prof. Izbicki said it was only a suggestion to make our bot politically focused, I decided to make my bot cat themed instead! You'll see just how purrfect the comments are. ðŸ˜½

## B. Favorite Comment
My favorite threads for my bot to comment on were those about cats. NotaCS40bot responded to many cat related posts that were shared in various subreddits. A screenshot of a funny reply is attached below.
